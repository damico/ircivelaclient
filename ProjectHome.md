Chat clients are very important to Learning Management Systems, but chat applications for eletronic distance education does not follow a standard and often does not support huge ammount of chat rooms and users. Also several implementations have a lot of features to common users (students) but no specific features to teachers. IRCIvelaClient aims to solve these problems.

IRCIvelaClient was developed using _JerkLib - A Java IRC Library_ http://jerklib.sourceforge.net/
